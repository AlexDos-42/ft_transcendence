THE PLAN TO DO PONG:

Matchmaking:

-Connect socket at pongGateway on mounted of the pong view.
-Button search game ---> join the array gameQueue.
-when two player or more pop them of the table and make them join a room.
-Send the roomId to both users, and tell them game found.
-in front redirect to game/:id with a button ready.
	limit the time people have to accept
-Button ready --> send event to server.
-How to param a game? choose params before ready? Have a loog on caceronzo site.
-Once both ready, start game.
-Add this game to ongoing game.
-How to stream game, send ongoing game to front?
-Emit game State, pos and score.
-Once finished add the scores to database, matchHistory of both users.

Piece of code to do:

Maybe connect the Socket in pongView and then pass the socket as props to the child components.
replace PongCanvas ---> GameView.

| |Pong View, show diffÃ©rente view: -Matchmaking view -with button search Game.
																											-Searching for a match view.
																											-Get redirected to pong/${gameId}
																		-GameView:	-Match found, button ready.
																								-Ongoing match.
																		-match finished view: Game stats, and back to matchaking button.
-Ajouter une route /pong/gameId.


| |Set up the Jwt auth in the pong Gateway.

| |Params the diffenrents socket events: 
	-"joinMatchmaking".Cli to Serv.
	-"matchFound".Serv to Cli.
	-"ready".Cli to serv.
	-"Keydown/up".Cli to serv. volatile.
	-"GameState".Serv to Cli. volatile.
	-"GameFinshed".Serv to Cli, maybe in gameState? finished: bool.

| |Watchgame: connect to pong gateway, and emit event "watchGame", GameId.
-How to not listen to spectator events? Separate rooms, if not in there, no socket.on ?

| |Game:
	-Add socket off both player, maybe params socket.on in there? would solve problem above.
	-Handle the two paddles, associate socket to a paddle.
	-Handle score, when ball leaves the field, add 1 to opposite side.
	-reset ball pos.
	-make ball slower at start.
	-handle game finished.

| |Database:
	-Define what to save and where, and then how?.

| |Find a way to do the private game.
	--->do not pass by matchmakingQueue.
	--->redirect to pongView, waiting for oppopent.
	--->Once opponent accept, redirect the component to pong view.
	--->add both to a room like when matchmaking find two player.
	--->the rest is like usual games.
